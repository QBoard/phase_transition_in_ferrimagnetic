Machine learning techniques as a data analysis tool has been proven its efficiency in numerous research areas during the last decade.
The reason for such popularity is the core idea behind all the employed methods â€“ inherent data pattern recognition, that is an essential part of scientific activity.
Physics is no exception since multiple ideas from statistical physics lie in the machine learning's foundation.

The variety of the machine learning methods can be distinguished into 2 groups: supervised and unsupervised methods.
First one requires categorised data as an input to compare the algorighm performance with the known label.
Unsupervised approaches need no prior data labeling and classifies input based on the hidden inner properties.

In physics classifiyng phases of matter is one of the key problems.
